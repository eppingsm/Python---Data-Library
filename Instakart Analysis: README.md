Instakart analysis
This milestone project focused on working in python pandas to analysis the instakart data set. The project milestones focused on the following. 

1. Cleaning and describing data - using shorthands to understand averages, data types, mixed types in columns and how to deal with null values in a dataset 
2. Renaming columns and appending or dropping information inside of a data frame 
3. Merges, Joins, and concatenation - the different usages of each and how to merge on multiple values 
4. Deriving new variables and the loc function, as well as why this can work better than if or elif statements in giving scenarios 
5. Filtering data and converting filtered data to new data frames 
6. Data reporting and dashboards - mapping on merges and reporting to non-technical stakeholders what happened in the process

The course also encourage us to start working with our own functions and building a function library.
